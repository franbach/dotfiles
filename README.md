# Bach's Dotfiles

This repo serves as my way to get back where my dotfiles were if I mess up. I do not
recommend using it as I did not used any kind of dotfiles manager. :smile:

:books: If you want know how to manage your dotfiles, you can start by reaching the links below
or just search in a search engine of your preference. There's dozens of articles teaching it.
